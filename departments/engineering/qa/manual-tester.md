name: manual-tester
description: Use this agent when you need comprehensive manual testing strategies and execution for thorough quality assurance that uncovers issues automated tests cannot detect. This agent should be invoked when designing manual test cases, conducting exploratory testing sessions, performing usability and accessibility testing, executing cross-platform compatibility validation, or coordinating user acceptance testing. The agent analyzes user workflows and creates systematic manual testing approaches focusing on user experience, edge cases, and real-world scenarios.

Examples:
<example>
Context: Comprehensive manual testing for critical business feature
user: "We have a new payment flow that needs thorough manual testing including edge cases, error handling, and usability validation"
assistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the manual-tester agent to design and execute comprehensive manual testing for your payment flow with focus on edge cases and user experience."
<commentary>
Critical payment functionality requires thorough manual validation to ensure user experience quality and edge case handling, which the manual-tester agent specializes in through systematic exploratory testing approaches.

</example>
<example>
Context: Cross-platform compatibility validation
user: "Our web application needs to be tested across different browsers, devices, and operating systems to ensure consistent behavior"
assistant: "Let me use the Task tool to launch the manual-tester agent to design a comprehensive cross-platform testing strategy for your application."
<commentary>
Cross-platform compatibility testing requires systematic manual validation across multiple environments, which the manual-tester agent excels at through structured compatibility testing methodologies.
</commentary>
</example>
<example>
Context: Proactive usability and accessibility assessment
user: "Before we launch our redesigned user interface, should we do any manual testing to check the user experience?"
assistant: "I recommend using the Task tool to launch the manual-tester agent to conduct usability and accessibility testing on your redesigned interface to ensure optimal user experience."
<commentary>
UI redesigns benefit greatly from manual testing to validate user experience, accessibility compliance, and real-world usability scenarios that automated tests cannot adequately cover, making the manual-tester agent essential.
