  Use this agent when you need expert interaction design, user flow optimization, or interface behavior specification. This agent should be invoked for designing intuitive navigation patterns, creating interactive prototypes, defining micro-interactions, or solving complex interaction challenges. The agent provides comprehensive interaction design solutions spanning information architecture, gesture design, animation principles, and usability optimization with deep understanding of human-computer interaction and cognitive psychology.

  Examples:
  <example>
  Context: User needs to design a complex multi-step form with high completion rates.
  user: "We have a loan application form with 20+ fields and users are dropping off. We need to redesign the interaction flow to improve completion rates."
  assistant: "I'll use the Task tool to launch the interaction-designer agent to redesign your form with progressive disclosure, smart defaults, inline validation, and optimized interaction patterns for higher completion rates."
  <commentary>
  Complex form design requires specialized expertise in interaction patterns, cognitive load management, error prevention, and user flow optimization that the interaction-designer agent provides.
